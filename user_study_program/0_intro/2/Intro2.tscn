In this study, I will show you some ChromaDepth images.
These are regular pictures that I added colour to, to get a ChromaDepth effect.







[wave amp=20 freq=2]Tip: you can also click on these images to make them bigger![/wave]

I have made multiple different variations of each image.
You have to give these variations a 'colour score' and a 'depth score'.
The higher one score, the lower the other, so you will have to balance them out to what you think is right.

The closer the ChromaDepth image looks to the original image, the higher the colour score is.
So: the grass should be green, the sky should be blue, bananas should be yellow, ...
Of course, I will show you the original image, so you know what to compare to.

The more depth the ChromaDepth image has, the higher the depth score is.
So: far-away things should look far away, close-by things should look close-by, ...
